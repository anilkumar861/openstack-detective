Troubleshooting Checks needed:  

## TEST THIS AGAINST KOLLA - SOME THINGS LIKE SYSTEMCTL MAY HAVE TO CHANGE
General
* Check for NTP/Chronyd 
* Validate time in sync across ALL nodes 
* Check disk space on all nodes
* Check log rotation on nodes?
* A few common browbeat checks (https://github.com/openstack/browbeat/blob/master/ansible/check/roles/common/tasks/main.yml)
** Verify selinux running
** Check tuned running and correct profile 


Per Service
* Check packages installed 
* Check services running 
* Check configuration files - at least for basic things
* Verify connection from string in config to DB
** Verify DB has tables
* Confirm user/pw auth thru keystone
** Confirm endpoints?  
** Confirm service?  
* Test main list functionality (As shown below in basic functionality test)

Pacemaker 
  - Some help troubleshooting would be nice.  For instance, when I tried manually removing pacemaker remote all of a sudden my cluster crashed and wouldn't restart.  In this case, answers were in /var/log/messages 
   Maybe Beekhof's troubleshooting could be automated: http://blog.clusterlabs.org/blog/2013/debugging-pacemaker
  - Andrew Beekhof says 120s is the correct timeout for systemd based serviecs
    - pcs resource update $RESOURCE op start timeout=60s op stop timeout=60s

Heat stack troubleshooting - In particular, simplifying nested stack troubleshooting with Director... 

Neutron
* Add some capability to connection test a VM end to end
** Make certain it is there correctly on all hops
** Check for MTU mismatch 


Glance 

HA tests 
* Check mysql data replication
* verify amount of tables in DB is same on each node
* Check galera envionment state
* RabbitMQ availability 
* RabbitMQ replication 
* check pacemaker status

Base Functional Tests / Smoke Test 
* Run 'list' commands per service
* Check that required services are running (and enabled via systemd or pacemaker) 
* Functional tests (like cinder create/delete, glance image-create, download, etc)

Add a config check for Ceph backend.  
  -> Just to verify pools, auth, etc...
